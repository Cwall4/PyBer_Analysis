# PyBer_Analysis

Both parts of the Module Challenge are in PyBer_Challenge.ipynb.

# Part 1: Create a PyBer Summary DataFrame

Comparing the values of the three city types, it looks like Pyber is least popular in Rural areas by all measures. Urban cities have the highest total rides, drivers, and fares. Suburban areas fall in between the two.

The average fares per ride and driver are the opposite, however. My hypothesis is that in less dense areas both drivers and customers are less frequent, but riders tend to take longer (and therefore more expensive) drives.

# Part 2: Create a Multiple-Line Plot for the Sum of the Fares for Each City Type

My multiple-line plot was saved in the 'analysis' folder as "ChallengeFig1.png".

It shows that from January to April 2019, total fares in urban areas were ~$2000/week, consistently above suburban fares of ~$1000/week and rural fares of <$500/week.
